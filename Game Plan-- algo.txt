POS tag     ------------ Done
extract nouns ------------- Done
query table for direct match of each/all nouns in nouns array-> add to results to matches array -> check match array for overlap of nouns -> if overlap then return that one row
else return all rows. 
	
if result of query is found -> Then query lookup table for correlation of word to column -> add matches to look up array. 

search for overlap of lookup array. -> if no overlap search direct match 


if no match spell check -> if still no match return row. (expansion possible here too)
if no match return error checking issues *this is where we will expand the algo for NLP stuff (use spell checking, base words, etc).
