1.
capture edge case flags (When, where, who, years, etc subject to expansion). 

2.
//These can be implemented as a function which can be called with either nonmatchedwords or nonmatchednouns to get an answer. 
//these two can be implemented in any order just test which one returns the most accurate results the most times.

Implement Word net. It will be ran IFF no matches on words or nouns.
Implement spellcheck IFF no matches on words or nouns 

3.
before monday we need to update the lookup_table to include the basic column titles from all the tables (ommitted for testing of one to one function)


4.
Start working on the switch statment to handle issues like edge cases and exceptions: //this is not a full or encompasing list by any means.
	switch(flag):
		case flag1: basic one to one look up select statement
		case flag2: one to one with year
		case flag3: no lookup table match return all noun match information
		case flag4: edge case 1
		case flag5: edge case 2
		case flagN: edge case N

//(other non matches will also need to be explored.  no noun match, or no match at all. )

The general structure of what is ran between //todo start and //todo end can be used in all cases regardless of edge cases, the switch is moreso to generate what we are returning to
the user based on the type of results we have found.
