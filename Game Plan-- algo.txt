#todo UPDATE THIS WHEN DONE!
by jonathan

1.
capture edge case flags (When, where, who, years, etc subject to expansion).
//todo
1a. we are working on max min. they will be the same process the only difference will be the SQL statement. (p1) in progress

2. Temporality -- get most recent result if year not specified. (p1) in  progress

3.  Working -- in progress need cases to fail so we can test the premise of how wordnet finds and inserts words later (P3)



4.  SOME ARE DONE //not actually implementing the switch at this point till we do code clean up and can identify what will be reused
Start working on the switch statement to handle issues like edge cases and exceptions: //this is not a full or encompasing list by any means.
	switch(flag):
		case flag1: basic one to one look up select statement                             CASE DONE
		case flag2: one to one with year                                                  CASE DONE
		case flag3: no lookup table match return all noun match information               NOT DONE (p2)
		case flag4: MIN/MAX                                                               Needs completion (p1) in progress
		case flag5: comparison                                                            Needs completion (p1)
		case flagN: edge case N
